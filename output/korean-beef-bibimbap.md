1. Wash and dry all produce\. Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in a small pot\. Halve zucchini lengthwise; slice into thin half\-moons\. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms and scallions, keeping scallion greens and whites separate\. Peel carrot; using a peeler, shave lengthwise into ribbons\. Peel and mince ginger\. Mince garlic\.
2. Once water is boiling, add rice and a pinch of salt to pot\. Cover, lower heat, and reduce to a gentle simmer\. Cook until tender, 15\-20 minutes\.
3. Toss scallion whites with vinegar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl\. Set aside to marinate\. In another small bowl, stir together sesame oil, 1½ TBSP sugar, up to half the sriracha, and 1½ TBSP soy sauce \(we’ll use the rest of the sriracha and soy sauce later\)\.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium\-high heat \(use a nonstick pan if you have one\)\. Add carrot; season with salt and pepper\. Cook, tossing, until tender but still crisp, 3\-4 minutes\. Remove from pan and set aside\. Add another drizzle of oil to pan and repeat with zucchini; remove from pan once cooked\. Add mushrooms and another drizzle of oil to pan and cook until tender, 3\-5 minutes\. Season with salt and pepper\. Remove from pan and set aside\.
5. Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium\-high heat\. Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds\. Add beef, breaking up meat into pieces\. Cook, tossing occasionally, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes\. Increase heat to high and continue cooking until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes\. Pour in remaining soy sauce and cook, tossing, until mostly evaporated, 1\-2 minutes\. Season with salt and pepper\.
6. Divide rice between bowls\. Arrange beef, zucchini, carrot, mushrooms, and scallion whites on top\. Drizzle with sauce and remaining sriracha \(to taste\)\. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve\.
